macro for flowbitcoin and 15bit.eu, more coming



Hi all,

I wrote 2 quick macros (use imacros extension for firefox or chrome) that have averaged 70,000 satoshi a day. These work on both 15bit.eu and flowbitcoin.

You will get higher returns with flowbitcoin, where the faucet is every minute.

How to get started:

1) get imacros extension for your browser.

2) download these macros


3) sign up to each site:

http://flowbitcoin.com/?ref=1029650

http://15bit.eu/?ref=251448

4) play macro on each site for as long as you want. 



Tip: When I wrote these, the window kept popping up when it reloaded. I found that using these in firefox, while I use chrome for everything else, keeps the macros working in the background.
