macro for flowbitcoin and 15bit.eu, more coming


Hi all,

I wrote 2 quick macros that have averaged 70,000 satoshi a day. These work on both 15bit.eu and flowbitcoin.

You will get higher returns with flowbitcoin, where the faucet is every minute.

How to get started:

1) Get imacros extension for your browser. I've only used it in firefox and chrome.

2) Download the macros from my github:

3) Sign up to each site:

http://flowbitcoin.com/?ref=1029650

http://15bit.eu/?ref=251448

4) Play macro on each site for as long as you want. Make sure to use a separate window for each site, with no other tabs in those windows.

Thank you! If these bots worked for you, please feel free to donate some BTC so I can bring out more tools:

Tip: When I wrote these, the window kept popping up when it reloaded. I found that using these in firefox, while I use chrome for everything else, keeps the macros working in the background.
